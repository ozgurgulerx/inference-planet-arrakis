[Daily journal](../../days/) — the Day 001 README will be linked here only after Özgür adds it.

## Overview
Qwen3.8 is a dense (not MoE) vision-language model built on Qwen3.6 architecture. 
Unique point with qwen3.8 is the hybrid attention. 
It has gated DeltaNet layers mixed with full attention layers.

1. Architecture and memory 
(DeltaNet + FFN → DeltaNet + FFN → DeltaNet + FFN → full attention + FFN) X 16 = 64 layers 
Giving 48 DeltaNet layers and 16 full-attention layers.
Full attention layers have 24 query heads, four KV heads, and a head dimension of 256.

Mweights​≈27×109×2=54 GB≈50.3 GiB

3. PRefill versus decode 
4. Hybrid Attention
5. Quantization and batching 
6. Reasoning and speculation
