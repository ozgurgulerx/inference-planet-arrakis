# 02 — Models

Model-specific workspaces for architecture notes, study plans, experiments, and findings.

Part 01 covers the five core model families listed in Day 001. Numbered folders reflect my current study order, starting with Qwen3.8-27B. I can change that order as I go. Exact checkpoint identifiers and revisions will be recorded when selected for an experiment.

| Model / family | Workspace |
| --- | --- |
| Qwen3.8-27B | [01-qwen3.8-27b/](01-qwen3.8-27b/README.md) |
| GLM-4.7-Flash | [02-glm-4.7-flash/](02-glm-4.7-flash/README.md) |
| GLM-5.3-Flash | [03-glm-5.3-flash/](03-glm-5.3-flash/README.md) |
| DeepSeek lineage → V4.1 Flash | [04-deepseek-v4.1-flash/](04-deepseek-v4.1-flash/README.md) |
| Nemotron 3.5 Lightning | [05-nemotron-3.5-lightning/](05-nemotron-3.5-lightning/README.md) |

Each workspace has a `README.md` for the overview, study checklist and experiment index; `architecture.md` for authored architecture notes; and `experiments/` for model-specific configurations, raw results and findings. The authoring sections are empty. Create individual experiment folders when work begins, such as `experiments/experiment-001-subject/`.

Keep one canonical report per experiment and link to it from the relevant day. Record the exact checkpoint revision, runtime version, hardware/topology, precision, workload and configuration with each experiment. Keep reusable benchmark helpers separate from model-specific reports.

For a journal day under `01-days/day-NNN-YYMMDD-subject/`, a model link can be:

```markdown
[Qwen model workspace](../../02-models/01-qwen3.8-27b/README.md)
```

Model study documents live here in `inference-planet-arrakis/02-models/`, alongside the public `01-days/`. Guidance, methodology, career information, credentials and assessment records remain private outside this public repository. Check the contents of each model document before publishing; a model folder is not a place for private evaluator notes or scores.
